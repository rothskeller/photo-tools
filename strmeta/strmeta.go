/* Limitations:

Some of the metadata in the Metadata structure are more limited in their values
than the metadata formats of the underlying files can represent.  These include:
  * Some file formats can support multiple creators for a media.
  * Some file formats support more than one location shown in a media.
  * Some file formats support specifying the title and caption, and the place
    names in the locations, in multiple languages.
In addition, the underlying metadata formats support a plethora of other
metadata tags that I don't use at all.
